# Physical AI Textbook Portal

Welcome to the **Physical AI Textbook**, your guide to embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics.

The content is organized into:

1. **Textbook Documentation** – this section contains the theoretical content, explanations, and overviews.  
2. **Chatbot Knowledge Base** – accessible at `/chatbot`, containing:
   - **Four main modules**:  
     - Module 01 — Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)  
     - Module 02 — Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)  
     - Module 03 — AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)  
     - Module 04 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA)  
   - **Chatbot-aware chapters** (e.g., `book-chapter.md`) that map hackathon requirements and provide guided exercises.

## How to Use This Portal

- Start with the [Chatbot Modules](/chatbot) for **hands-on guidance**.  
- Follow the sidebar links for a **structured overview** of all chapters.
