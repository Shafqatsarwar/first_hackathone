# Parameters and Runtime Adaptation

ROS parameters allow runtime tuning without redeployment, enabling personalization and adaptive behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Use ROS parameters for adaptation  
- Enable runtime personalization  

## Core Concepts
Parameters are centralized, discoverable, and can be dynamically reconfigured. They let teams tweak controllers, thresholds, and AI heuristics while the robot is running.

## Embodied Intelligence Perspective
Adaptation mirrors biological learning processes by fine-tuning behavior on the fly.

## Key Takeaways
- Parameters unlock flexibility  
- Runtime adaptation increases robustness
