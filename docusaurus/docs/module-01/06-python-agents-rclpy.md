# Python AI Agents with rclpy

Python accelerates AI development. The `rclpy` client library lets Python agents subscribe to topics, call services, and interact with actions while keeping ROS 2 semantics intact.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate Python-based AI into ROS 2 nodes  
- Use `rclpy` to bridge cognition and low-level control  

## Core Concepts
High-level cognition often runs slower than deterministic control. `rclpy` orchestrates messaging, allowing AI planners to push goals while deterministic controllers maintain safety-critical loops.

## Embodied Intelligence Perspective
Teaching Python agents requires respecting real-time constraints by offloading heavy computation to separate threads or nodes.

## Key Takeaways
- Python enables rapid AI prototyping  
- `rclpy` bridges cognition, planning, and control
