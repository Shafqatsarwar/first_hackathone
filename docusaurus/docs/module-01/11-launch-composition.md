# Launch and Composition

ROS 2 launch files and composition allow you to bring sets of nodes online deterministically so the humanoid nervous system boots with valid configurations.

## Learning Objectives
- Create launch descriptions for multi-node systems  
- Compose nodes into a single process for performance  

## Core Concepts
Launch files declaratively describe nodes, parameters, and remappings, while composition lets you instantiate multiple nodes in one process to reduce resource overhead.

## Embodied Intelligence Perspective
Predictable startup and reproducible node sets are essential for safety-critical humanoid deployments.

## Key Takeaways
- Launch files orchestrate boot sequences  
- Composition brings cohesion and performance
