# URDF and the Humanoid Body

URDF defines links, joints, mass, inertia, and collision geometry, grounding AI in the robot's physical reality.

## Learning Objectives
- Model humanoid structures  
- Define joints, constraints, mass, and inertia  

## Core Concepts
URDF encodes the skeleton, sensors, and actuators, so simulation and real hardware share a consistent representation.

## Embodied Intelligence Perspective
AI must understand the body it controls to reason about forces, reach, and balance.

## Key Takeaways
- URDF grounds intelligence physically
