# Bridging LLM Reasoning with Deterministic Control

LLMs generate symbolic plans while deterministic controllers execute motor commands safely; the architecture must keep the two systems separated but coordinated.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate LLM reasoning safely  
- Preserve deterministic control loops  

## Core Concepts
LLMs propose high-level actions. Deterministic subsystems verify these actions against safety constraints before issuing motor commands.

## Embodied Intelligence Perspective
Cognition proposes actions; physics enforces constraints and prevents unsafe maneuvers.

## Key Takeaways
- LLMs guide action selection  
- Deterministic controllers maintain safety
