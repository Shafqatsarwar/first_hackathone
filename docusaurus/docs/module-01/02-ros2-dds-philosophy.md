# ROS 2 & DDS Philosophy

ROS 2 relies on the DDS (Data Distribution Service) ecosystem to make pub-sub reliable, secure, and real-time capable. In this document, we review the quality of service settings, discovery processes, and node lifecycle that keep the nervous system healthy.

- Understand antipatterns that happen when QoS mismatches occur.
- Learn how discovery and security plugins in DDS affect distributed deployments.
- Review lifecycle transitions for resilient controllers.
