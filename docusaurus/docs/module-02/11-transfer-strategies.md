# Simulation-to-Real Transfer Strategies

Deploy AI models from simulation to real humanoids with progressive testing, fine-tuning, and safety validation.  

## Learning Objectives
- Deploy AI models from simulation to physical robots  
- Mitigate errors during transfer  

## Key Takeaways
- Simulation is a preparatory stage, not a substitute  
- Incremental deployment ensures safe embodied intelligence
