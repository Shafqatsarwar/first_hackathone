# Physics Simulation Fundamentals

Accurate physics simulation models gravity, collisions, contact dynamics, and joint constraints so control strategies behave reliably before hitting hardware.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand gravity, collisions, and contact dynamics  
- Apply realistic physics to humanoid robots  

## Core Concepts
Physics simulation covers Newtonian mechanics, rigid-body dynamics, joint limits, and contact forces. Fidelity ensures AI respects physical limitations.

## Key Takeaways
- Physics fidelity is critical for safe deployment
