# Humanoid Locomotion Simulation

Humanoid locomotion needs center-of-mass control, precise foot placement, and torque-aware joints. Simulation lets you test gait strategies safely.

## Learning Objectives
- Simulate walking, running, and posture  
- Understand kinematic and dynamic constraints  

## Key Takeaways
- Locomotion must respect physical and actuator constraints
