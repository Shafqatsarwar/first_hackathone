# Digital Twins in Embodied Intelligence

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a humanoid robot, including sensors, actuators, dynamics, and control logic. It enables safe experimentation, scalable AI training, and rapid iteration without risking hardware.

## Learning Objectives
- Define digital twins in robotics  
- Explain the benefits of high-fidelity simulation  

## Core Concepts
Digital twins emulate the full embodied stack so teams can test behaviors, perception, and interactions before deploying to a real robot.

## Key Takeaways
- Digital twins reduce risk  
- Enable scalable AI experimentation
