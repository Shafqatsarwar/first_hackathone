# Path Planning Under Physical Constraints

Humanoid robots require physics-aware planning to respect joint torque, balance, and collision avoidance.

## Learning Objectives
- Respect joint torque and balance limits  
- Plan safe trajectories  

## Key Takeaways
- Safe paths require physics-aware planning
