# Archived docs

The module and hardware folders were archived to keep the demo clean. If you need to restore any archived content, move files back into `docusaurus/docs/` and update `docusaurus/sidebars.js`.

# Archived folders and migrated content:

- `module1/`, `module2/`, `module3/`, `module4/`, `hardware/`, `weekly/`

Additionally, `my-first_hackathone/docs/doc1.md`, `doc2.md`, and `doc3.md` were reviewed and a concise demo chapter (`book-chapter.md`) was added to the active docs.

These folders were empty in the current repository snapshot and are preserved here as a reminder. To re-enable module navigation, recreate files under `docusaurus/docs/` and add them to `sidebars.js`.
