# Book Overview — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This interactive textbook teaches how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots that interact naturally with people and environments. The demo site includes:

- Short chapters explaining core concepts (ROS 2, simulation, perception, VLA)
- A RAG-powered chat demo to ask questions about the book content
- Hands-on exercises and sample code hosted in the repository

Use the `context.txt` file at the repository root to test the RAG ingestion workflow (see the project `GUIDE.md` for commands). For safe local testing, keep `MOCK_MODE=true` in your `.env` to avoid external LLM calls.

Replace this overview with your preferred book intro or a PDF-exported chapter when ready.
