# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon Project Constitution

 ## Requirements

You are required to complete a unified book project using Agent and Spec-Kit Plus. The core deliverables are:

1. AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Write a book using Docusaurus(https://docusaurus.io/) and deploy it to GitHub Pages. You will use Spec-Kit Plus ( https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/ ) and any suitable Agent to write a book.
