**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Learning Scenarios & Assessment *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Learning scenarios should be PRIORITIZED as student learning journeys ordered by importance.
  Each learning scenario/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  students should still gain valuable knowledge that builds toward overall course objectives.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each scenario as a standalone learning module that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently with students
  - Integrated independently into course curriculum
  - Demonstrated to educators independently
-->

### Learning Scenario 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this learning journey in plain language, how students will engage with the material]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the educational value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Assessment**: [Describe how student learning can be assessed independently - e.g., "Can be fully assessed through [specific exercise] and demonstrates [specific competency]"]

**Learning Objectives**:

1. **Students will understand**: [key concept 1]
2. **Students will demonstrate**: [key skill 1]
3. **Students will apply**: [key application 1]

---

### Learning Scenario 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this learning journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the educational value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Assessment**: [Describe how student learning can be assessed independently]

**Learning Objectives**:

1. **Students will understand**: [key concept 2]
2. **Students will demonstrate**: [key skill 2]

---

### Learning Scenario 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this learning journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the educational value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Assessment**: [Describe how student learning can be assessed independently]

**Learning Objectives**:

1. **Students will understand**: [key concept 3]
2. **Students will demonstrate**: [key skill 3]

---

[Add more learning scenarios as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Pedagogical Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right pedagogical edge cases.
-->

- How do students with [different background] approach [complex concept]?
- What happens when [boundary learning condition] occurs?
- How does the curriculum handle [diverse learning needs]?

## Content Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right educational requirements.
-->

### Instructional Requirements

- **IR-001**: Content MUST follow educational principles outlined in our constitution, emphasizing hands-on learning through practical applications
- **IR-002**: Materials MUST include clear learning objectives, concept summaries, and exercises at appropriate difficulty levels
- **IR-003**: Students MUST be able to understand complex Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts through accessible explanations
- **IR-004**: Content MUST include code examples, mathematical formulations, and practical implementations that are technically accurate
- **IR-005**: Materials MUST connect academic concepts to real-world robotics and AI applications in industry

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **IR-006**: Content MUST address student prerequisites via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: assumed background knowledge - math level, programming skills, robotics familiarity?]
- **IR-007**: Curriculum MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: hardware requirements - simulation environments, physical robots?]

### Key Learning Concepts *(include if chapter involves data)*

- **[Concept 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Concept 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other concepts]

## Educational Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable educational success criteria.
  These must be pedagogically sound and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Learning Outcomes

- **SO-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Students can implement a basic robot controller in under 3 hours"]
- **SO-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Students demonstrate understanding of sensor fusion with 85% accuracy"]
- **SO-003**: [Learning satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of students rate concept explanations as clear and accessible"]
- **SO-004**: [Knowledge retention metric, e.g., "Students retain core robotics concepts with 80% accuracy after 4 weeks"]
