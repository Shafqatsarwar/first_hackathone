# Actuators, Sensors, and Feedback Loops

This chapter explains how sensors, actuators, and closed-loop feedback keep the humanoid's nervous system stable.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand actuator dynamics and sensor suites  
- Design feedback loops that preserve balance  

## Core Concepts
Actuators execute commands issued by controllers, while sensors feed the nervous system with state information. Feedback loops compare desired with actual states and drive corrections continuously.

## Embodied Intelligence Perspective
Close physical systems cannot afford drift; feedback keeps reality aligned with intention.

## Key Takeaways
- Feedback loops maintain stability  
- Sensors and actuators are the physical endpoints of ROS 2 communication
