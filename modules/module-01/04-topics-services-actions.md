# Topics, Services, and Actions

This chapter enumerates the communication primitives that ROS 2 exposes: topics for broadcast telemetry, services for synchronous control, and actions for cancellable behaviors.

- Design telemetry pipelines with appropriately throttled topics.
- Use services for configuration and initialization steps.
- Model mission-level goals with actions to receive feedback and preemption.
