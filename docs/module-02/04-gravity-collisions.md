# Gravity, Collisions, and Contact Dynamics

Collision detection and response plus gravity modeling are essential for humanoid locomotion and manipulation. Without them balance and impact handling fail.

## Learning Objectives
- Model humanoid interactions with the environment  
- Simulate falls, impacts, and friction  

## Key Takeaways
- Accurate contact dynamics are essential for reliable AI
