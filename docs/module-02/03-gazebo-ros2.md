# Gazebo Architecture and ROS 2 Integration

Gazebo provides physics engine integration, sensor simulation, and real-time bridges to ROS 2 nodes to run multi-node systems end to end.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2  
- Simulate multi-node humanoid systems  

## Core Concepts
Gazebo plugs into ROS 2 via ROS plugins and topics, allowing controllers and planners to exercise virtual hardware inside a realistic physics world.

## Key Takeaways
- Gazebo + ROS 2 enables end-to-end simulation  
- Supports modular development
