# Domain Randomization Techniques

Domain randomization adds variability (textures, lighting, positions) so models generalize beyond the training simulator.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply randomization to bridge the reality gap  
- Improve model generalization  

## Key Takeaways
- Domain randomization is key to simulation-to-reality transfer
