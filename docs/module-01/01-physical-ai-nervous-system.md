# Physical AI Nervous System

This chapter introduces the concept of a robotic nervous system built on ROS 2. Physical AI teams raw sensing, planning, and actuation by wiring sensors through ROS nodes so the humanoid platform can sense and react in real time.

Key takeaways:
- ROS 2 is the middleware that binds sensors, planners, and controllers into a cohesive nervous system.
- Topics, services, and actions provide flexible communication patterns between nodes.
- DDS underneath ROS 2 enables resilience for distributed robots.
